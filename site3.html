        Dashashwamedh Ghat is a main ghat in Varanasi located on the Ganges River in Uttar Pradesh. It is located close to Vishwanath Temple. There are two Hindu legends associated with the ghat: according to one, Brahma created it to welcome Shiva, and in another, Brahma performed 10 Ashwamegha Yajna, Dasa-Ashwamedha yajna.The present ghat was built by Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao in the year 1748. A few decades later, Ahilyabahi Holkar, the Queen of Indore, rebuilt the ghat in the year 1774.The Ganga Aarti (ritual of offering prayer to the Ganges river) is held daily at dusk. Several priests perform this ritual by carrying deepam and moving it up and down in a rhythmic tune of bhajans.[2] Special aartis are held on Tuesdays and on religious festivals.The Ganga Aarti starts soon after sunset and lasts for about 45 minutes. In the summer, the Aarti begins at about 7pm due to late sunsets and in winter it starts at around 6pm. Hundreds of people gather at the ghat every evening to watch the event.
